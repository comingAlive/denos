### Add Tailwind CSS to Next.js project ([Raw](https://denos.cc/raw/add-tailwind-to-next.ts))

In your project folder run:

```bash
deno run --allow-write --allow-read --allow-run https://denos.cc/add-tailwind-to-next.ts
```
By default it uses pnpm. If you don't have pnpm, it will use npm. You can force it by adding --npm/--yarn after the module name.
